# 🐱 Random Cat Images

Simple project that consumes a public API to display random cat images. Every time the **"Search a Cat"** button is clicked, a new cat image is dynamically loaded on the screen.

This project was developed with the goal of learning how to consume APIs and perform basic DOM manipulation.
